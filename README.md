- Implement generic methods of the class *ArrayExtension*. The task definitions are given in the  XML-comments for each method.
- To test generic methods of the class ArrayExtension, follow these steps:
    - Add into the folder *Adaptee* implementation of the class *DoubleExtension* solution of this [task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/ieee754/-/blob/master/IEEE754FormatTask/DoubleExtension.cs).
    - Add into the folder *Adaptee* implementation of the class *ContainsDigitPredicate* solution of this [task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/filter-strategy/-/blob/master/FilterStrategyTask.Tests/PredicateImplementations/ContainsDigitPredicate.cs).
    - Put into the folder *Adapters* adapter classes that implement the required interfaces.
    - Put into the folder *Predicate* predicate classes for the different types.
    - Use classes adapter and predicate classes for develop unit and moq tests (put into the folders *NUnitTests* and *MoqTests*).
